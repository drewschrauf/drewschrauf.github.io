            <p><em>I should say right from the top that this isn't another blog post whining about the Mass Effect 3 ending. The issues I had with Mass Effect stretch all the way back through the series and, in fact, are common to almost every game that sells itself on your ability to choose your own destiny.</em></p>

<p>Games, like movies before them, are a form of escapism. They give you the chance to do things you wouldn't ordinarily be able to do in real life. This might be flying a SPAD in a dogfight during World War I, saving the world (again) from imminent destruction by an alien race or take the role of your favourite superhero fighting for truth, justice and the American way. Games like <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/mass-effect/62-560/">Mass Effect</a>, <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/dragon-age/62-1609/">Dragon Age</a> and <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/heavy-rain/61-21304/">Heavy Rain</a> appeal to me because they promise to give me a new way to challenge myself. By weaving a deep and intense fiction and cast of characters then giving me the power to make choices that affect the world I've come to love, they are capable of making an impact on me far greater than any book or movie possibly could.</p>

<p>There are two main ways that people like to approach games such as these. The first is to stay true to the game's role playing roots and assume a new identity along with a rich backstory and motivation. The second is to drop themselves into these games playing as closely to their own moral code as possible. Both play styles are valid but are still vulnerable to the same issue.</p>

<p>My problem with these games rears its ugly head when the game decides to enforce a "correct" way to play. It may not do it in as many words but as soon as the game offers rewards outside story beats for making only "good" or "evil" choices, the entire notion of giving the player a choice goes out the window. Gamers, by nature, are problem problem solvers. They have been programmed by the long history of videogames to look for a way to win. While its possible for a gamer to ignore the gameplay benefits of playing a "perfect" game, to many this seems like intentionally choosing to pick a sub-superior path through the game. When given a way to win, gamers will almost always instinctually pick that path.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/mass-effect-2/61-21590/">Mass Effect 2</a> was particularly guilty of this issue. By opening up new conversation options for consistently choosing the "good" or "evil" options, they essentially gave you a Get out of Jail Free card for many of the most difficult decisions. Numerous times throughout the story you were faced with potentially difficult choices that could affect not only the fiction but had gameplay impacts too. However, if a player had attempted to play a "perfect" game up to that point, Mass Effect 2 frequently gave the player a dialogue option that completely skipped the need to make a decision and allowed them continue without any negative impact, story-wise or other.</p>

<p>One example of this was solving numerous arguments between your crew members. The motley crew that travelled with you throughout the universe was comprised of humans and aliens from all corners of the galaxy, each with their own prejudices and motivations. It makes sense that two crew members from races that were long-time enemies would argue and give you an ultimatum stating "it's me or them". Having become quite attached to both of these characters over the 30+ hour game, making a choice such as this promised to be difficult and challenge my own moral code. Gamers that had stuck to playing strictly "good" or "evil" though were given a dialogue option that convinced both crew members to get past their differences and focus their attention on the greater enemy threatening the universe, essentially allowing them to skip the choice altogether.</p>

<p>This issue isn't at all unique to Mass Effect. Game developers in general seem to have an innate desire to provide the player with a winning move, even at the expense of the integrity of their own creative work. It's a shame, as games have the potential to deliver so much more than movies or books are capable of. I'm looking forward to an developer, perhaps an indie dev with less more of a desire to do something new, coming in to fill this gaping whole in game design philosophy.</p>

<p>So, my plea to developers is simple. <strong>Force me to make those hard choices</strong>. Sure, you're making a game and a notion of "winning" typically goes along with that but when you give me a way of gaming the system, as it were, you completely undermine the experience you're trying to create. Problems without a correct answer are usually the most interesting.</p>
