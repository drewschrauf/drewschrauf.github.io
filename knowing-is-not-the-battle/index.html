        <section class="post-content">
            <p>So, I finally decided to give this blogging thing a try and, like any good programmer, I spent far too much time picking a blogging platform. While <a href="http://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> and <a href="http://tumblr.com">Tumblr</a> seem to be the current favourites, I wanted something that was a little easier to configure and manage. As I searched, I stumbled across a new wave of blogging engines known as static site generators (SSGs) which generate a static website from a set of input files. SSGs give you less out of the box for free but keep things nice and simple.</p>

<p>This simplicity seems to attract a lot of people looking for the same things as I was but there is also another crowd being drawn in. More than a few times I saw commenters champion these systems because they "don't like using systems they don't completely understand". If this is you then you're <strong>doing it wrong</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, there are plenty of reasons why you might want to go with a more simple solution than that offered by Wordpress and its contemporaries. My personal checklist was:</p>

<ul>
<li>easy to setup (locally and on the server)</li>
<li>easy to backup</li>
<li><p>easy to theme</p>

<p>I eventually settled on <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, a SSG based on <a href="http://http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> that ticked all of these boxes. Octopress also has another characteristic, the framework is small enough to understand in its entirety. It's so simple in fact that some people seem to believe that's <em>why</em> it exists. This is dangerous thinking for a programmer. Just because you <em>can</em> understand something, doesn't mean that you should.</p>

<p>What's that? I'm encouraging ignorance? Well, not really. There are plenty of things that you use every day that you don't understand entirely and that you shouldn't have to. The world is full of abstractions that hide the details of complex systems, exposing only the parts you need to interact with. When you flick your light switch, your lights turn on. When you turn on your tap, water flows out. Even something as complex as driving a car is abstracted down to two pedals (go faster, go slower) and a wheel for steering. You shouldn't need to see past these abstractions until something goes wrong. When it does, that's the time to break out the manual (or call a professional).</p>

<p>When a programmer says they don't want to use a software platform just because they don't understand how it works, I always feel that they're missing the point. Even if someone was able to understand the workings of Jekyll in their entirety (and that's not a huge stretch), what about the language it's written in, Ruby? And from there, the operating system it's running on? The instructions executed by the CPU? How the electricity is generated that allows the computer to run in the first place? Being a programmer necessitates an ability to draw a line at how much you need to know. Every good programmer draws a line in their knowledge somewhere and that's ok. The important thing is that you draw the line at where you <strong>need</strong> to understand to, not where you <strong>can</strong>.</p>

<p>So, when you find yourself digging into the bowels of a new system, be it software or anything else, ask yourself: Is this something you really need to know? Maybe knowing the bare minimum is good enough?</p></li>
