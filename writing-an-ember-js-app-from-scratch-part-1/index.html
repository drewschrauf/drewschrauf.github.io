            <p>I've recently been using <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> to streamline my javascript workflow. While I feel that it has cut right down on development time and I'm sure that maintenance will be a tonne easier, the ramp up time to becoming familiar and productive with it is certainly a lot longer than the old jQuery approach. The thought process for planning out an app is certainly a lot more involved but the resulting architecure virtually removes the capacity for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">spaghetti code</a>.</p>

<p>My biggest complaint with Ember is the lack of "getting started" guides out there. The documentation is phenomonal and there are numerous example projects to peruse, but there seems to be nothing that specifically deals with the process of writing an Ember app from scratch. In order to help other developers get up to speed quickly, I've decided to write up the full process I would take in writing a simple Ember app. To do this, I've decided to write a todo app based heavily off the Ember example from the (amazing) <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TodoMVC</a> project. I'll take my liberties with the actual code but the thought process is the important part here.</p>

<p>Before we begin, let me mention that I'm far from an Ember guru. Some of the things I've done here may not be best practice either due to my own ignorance or my desire to keep this series simple. At the very least, I hope this tutorial will whet your appetite to explore Ember further to find out how it can make your life easier!</p>

<p>To begin, I've grabbed a copy of the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> and have written the barebones HTML for a todo application.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="content"&gt;
    &lt;div id="create-todo"&gt;
        &lt;input id="new-todo" placeholder="What needs to be done?" type="text" value=""&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="stats-area"&gt;
        &lt;div class="mark-all-done"&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;
                &lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;Mark all as complete
            &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="todos"&gt;
        &lt;ul id="todo-list"&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;label&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" checked="checked"&gt;This is an item&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;
                &lt;label&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox"&gt;This is another item&lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id="todo-stats"&gt;
        &lt;button type="button"&gt;
            Clear 1 completed items
        &lt;/button&gt;
        1 items left
    &lt;/div&gt;      
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This example is intentionally extremely simple but will allow us to cover quite a few nifty features of Ember. The example HTML is split into four divs; one to create a new todo, one for utilities, one to display all of the todos and one to show stats about existing todos. The example also has a couple of items in there which we will soon replace with dynamic data.</p>

<p>To begin, we start by considering the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC architecture</a> imposed by Ember:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Model: These are the items that we are working with. We want them to be completely dumb and aware of only their own properties and state. In this case, the smallest item we are working with is a single todo item and we'll need to be able to track its title and a boolean representing whether or not it has been completed.</li>
<li>The View: This is the part of the app that is in charge of rendering out the relevant information based on our model. Views should also be reasonably dumb and merely aware of how to display themselves and how to route interactions with themselves to the appropriate business logic. My experience with defining views is to just add them as I need them. Their use should become more apparent as we continue.</li>
<li>The Controller: This is the beating heart of the app. The controller (or controller<strong>s</strong> in more complicated apps) stores a reference to the created models and is in charge of carrying out any business logic that is necessary. In our case, we can probably get away with a single controller that has a list of todo items and a few operations for interacting with them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we have broken down the application into its constituent parts, we can start writing our JS file:</p>

<pre><code>// We always create an Ember application in the first line
Todos = Ember.Application.create();

// Then we define our models which *extend* Ember.Object (so we can create instances)
Todos.Todo = Ember.Object.extend({
    title: null,
    isDone: false
});

// And finally we define a skeleton for our controller
// In this case we *create* an Ember.Object as we only want one of these objects and it should be created immediately
Todos.Controller = Ember.Object.create({
    // We need an array to hold our Todo objects
    todos: Ember.A(),

    // We also override the default init function to prepopulate some testing data
    init: function() {
        // Properties have to be accessed through their getters and setters
        var items = this.get('todos');
        items.addObject(Todos.Todo.create({title: 'This is an Ember item'}));
        items.addObject(Todos.Todo.create({title: 'This is another Ember item'}));
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>We now have a super simple controller that is storing two Todo objects. Already, our data structure is done and we can start adding dynamic views to display this data. To begin we need to wrap the entire dynamic section of the app in a <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> script tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/x-handlebars"&gt;
    &lt;div id="create-todo"&gt;

    &lt;!-- snip! --&gt;

        1 item left
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Reloading the page now won't appear to do anything but, infact, Ember has taken over rendering our UI using Handlebars templates and we can start binding the fields to our controller. The first thing we want to use this power for is replace our dummy items in the template with the real items from our controller. We'll just pop in an <code>each</code> iterator to loop over our objects:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id="todo-list"&gt;
    {{#each Todos.Controller.todos}}
        &lt;li&gt;
            {{view Ember.Checkbox titleBinding="title" valueBinding="isDone"}}
        &lt;/li&gt;
    {{/each}}
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We've now replaced the static list items with an <code>each</code> iterator and put something approximating our original markup inside of it. <code>each</code> iterates over whatever enumerable is passed to it, which in this case is our array of Todos we have in our controller. We've also replaced the entire <code>label</code>/<code>input</code> block of our original markup with one of Ember's predefined views, <code>Ember.Checkbox</code>. This is displaying the <code>title</code> of the current object as its label and using the <code>isDone</code> property of the current object as the value. When using HTML inputs like this, we almost always want to replace them with their Ember counterpart so that Ember knows what to do when its value is updated. The best part is, these items are directly bound to their respective objects so when the DOM is updated the model is too! Refreshing the page now will replace our original, static todo items with these dynamic ones.</p>

<p>To round the first part of this tutorial out, we'll make that little "items left" label at the bottom of the screen update dynamically so that we can see what affect our interactions are having on our model. In order to do this, we'll need to add a <a href="http://emberjs.com/documentation/#toc_computed-properties-getters">computed property</a> to our controller which returns the number of remaining items. Computed properties are functions that are accessed just like regular properties but will automatically update themselves based on a given criteria.</p>

<p>I typically like to think of the relationship between properties and computed properties almost as a spreadsheet. Most people are familiar with using Excel equations like <code>=SUM(A:A)</code> to automatically update a particular field when a different cell is modified. Computed properties do the exact same thing but allow you to get much more complicated with the logic. The dumber you leave your actual model and rely more on computed properties, the easier it's going to be to tweak logic during maintenance.</p>

<p>In our case, we'd like the count of remaining items to update every time an item is checked off. We'll use the <code>filterProperty</code> method of Ember arrays (which we're using to store our list of Todo items) to filter down the list and then we'll return the length of the resulting array.</p>

<pre><code>Todos.Controller = Ember.Object.create({
    todos: Ember.A(),

    // snip!

    remainingCount: function() {
        return this.get('todos').filterProperty('isDone', false).length;
    }.property('todos.@each.isDone')
});
</code></pre>

<p>To make the <code>remainingCount</code> function act as a computed property we've simply added <code>.property()</code> to the end of the function and passed in, as a parameter, an expression describing the fields we want to watch. In this case, we want to watch the <code>isDone</code> property of all of the Todo items so we use the <code>@each</code> syntax to keep an eye on all of objects in the list. We can then reference this count from our template just by replacing the hardcoded "2 items left" in our template with:</p>

<pre><code>{{Todos.Controller.remainingCount}} items left
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when we check a the <code>isDone</code> checkbox on a Todo item, the count at the bottom is automatically updated to reflect this. Pretty cool, huh?</p>

<p>Let's recap:</p>

<ul>
<li>Build your template first in straight HTML while you're learning Ember.</li>
<li>Separate your architecture into a dumb model, views and a smart controller.</li>
<li>Make your model as simple as possible and use computer properties to infer any additional data.</li>
<li>Replace your input controls with their Ember counterparts.</li>
</ul>

<p>In <a href="../blog/2012/07/09/writing-an-ember-js-app-from-scratch-part-2/index.html">part 2</a> we'll give our app the ability to create new Todo items and hook up the rest of the controls.</p>
